Hi! I am researcher primarily focused on the application and development of quantitative and computational methods in archaeology and anthropology.  I apply these techniques to tackle a variety of research themes, including prehistoric population dynamics, long-term changes in settlement patterns, and patterns and processes of cultural evolution. I use computer simulations to build theorethical models of cultural transmission and develop custom statistical models to handle chronological uncertainty that typically characterise the archaeological record. I am currently working on a [ERC project focused on the study of dispersal of farming in prehistoric Japan](https://ercrema.github.io/projects/). I am strongly committed to open science and an active developer of several [R packages](https://ercrema.github.io/rpackages/). You can find my institutional web page [here](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/directory/erc62).
