## _NEW!_ baorista  <img src="/files/baorista.png" align="right"/>
---
_baorista_ is an R package for analysing archaeological time-frequencies where each event is associated with chronological uncertainty. It is designed to be a Bayesian alternative to aoristic analysis. At its core _baorista_ provides a series of utility and wrapper functions based on [nimble](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nimble).

Developed with [Andrew Bevan](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/people/andrew-bevan-professor-spatial-and-comparative-archaeology), the _rcarbon_ R package enables the calibration and analysis of radiocarbon dates, often but not exclusively for the purposes of archaeological research. It includes functions not only for basic calibration, uncalibration, and plotting of one or more dates, but also a statistical framework for building demographic and related longitudinal inferences from aggregate radiocarbon date lists, including: Monte-Carlo simulation test [Timpson et al 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2014.08.011), random mark permutation test ([Crema et al 2016](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0154809), [Bevan et al 2017](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1709190114)) point-to-point test ([Edinborough et al 2017](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1713012114)), and spatial permutation test ([Crema, Bevan, and Shennan 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2017.09.007)).

_nimbleCarbon_ is an add-on library for the [nimble](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nimble) R package which provides utility functions and bespoke probability distributions for Bayesian analyses of radiocarbon dates. The package is particularly suited for demographic inferences based on changing frequencies of radiocarbon dates and enables parameter estimations and model comparison.
